# Detecting-Numbers-from-Jersey
In the present day Football operating system , everyone tries to use the power of machine learning as well computer vision to detect the players jersey , player jersey colour , football movement and much more . Many companies already achieved many things like Ball tracking , player detection etc from real time football . In this project i tried to detect the jersey number of  a foot ball player who is playing in the football ground !! That means this AI model will have the power to detect the player / team based on its jersey number.

### How it will work : 

The process how our algorithm works is something like this :

* First Player iamges are annotated from any real time football game , by using any video annotation tool !!

* Next the annotated player image will be passed to the computer vision model that will function to detect the proper edge , colour , carvature , Region of spread & homography of number part and will detect which number it is ? 

* Finally the number will be stored in a file in the operating system.

### Tech Stack used :
